        <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="story-paragraph">Tom and Amanda's stories are very similar--Tom grew up in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and Amanda grew up in the Green Bay area. They both attended college and graduated with degrees in Computer Science. Both received positions at the same company coming out of college, though they worked out of separate branches. Tom worked out of the Eau Claire office and Amanda worked from the Madison office.  They worked remotely on the same team for a while, until Tom decided to move down to the Madison branch.  The two of them became fast friends.  In addition to their chosen field they had a lot in common. Both had similar upbringings and are avid Green Bay Packer fans coming from more northern parts of Wisconsin.  Both still very new to the Madison area, they enjoyed exploring their new surroundings together with their friends. After a about year, they realized they had become inseparable and decided to start dating in 2015.</p>
        <p class="story-paragraph">Since then they have been on many adventures throughout their city, state, and country.  From Florida to Montana and many other places in between.  Camping, canoeing, hiking, along with yearly Green Bay Packer games.  They even played on the same Ultimate Frisbee team for a time. After two years of dating they took a trip out to Washington state. On that particular adventure they were visiting Olympic National Park.  They spent a several days at a lodge on Crescent Lake surrounded by the Olympic Mountains.  On the first day they woke early, hearing the night before that the road out was being closed, and drove to Port Angeles for a whale watching tour.  On the tour they witnessed a nuclear submarine coming into resupply, a humpback whale, and a group of Orcas making their day by swimming up to and directly under their boat.  The trip was like something out of a dream.</p>
        <p class="story-paragraph">After a few more days at the lodge they made their way over to the Pacific Ocean side of the peninsula to stay at an ocean-side Native American reservation in La Push.  There they spent a several days hiking the beaches. They celebrated the night of Amanda's birthday with a fire on the beach. The next day it was time for them to start their return trip, but there was one last stop. They had read about an amazing beach located along their route named Ruby Beach. They stopped and hiked down the path to the near perfect Washington beach.  There was even a lighthouse in view not far off, and the endless expanse of the Pacific Ocean in front of them. It was like something out of a painting. The beach was not void of other people, but it was not crowded yet.  Tom decided to steer their exploring toward several large rocks that looked to have an opening between them.  Once there, Amanda was distracted by the ocean life leftover from the last tide.  She did not notice Tom had stopped and bent down on one knee until she turned to point something out to him.  On that day, September 15th, 2017, Tom asked Amanda to marry him on Ruby Beach, WA</p>
