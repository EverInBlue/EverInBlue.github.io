    <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
    <!--<p>Tom grew up in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. He attended the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire and graduated with a degree in Computer Science. Out of school, he began working at Great Lakes as a software developer</p>

    <p>Amanda grew up in the Green Bay area. She attended the University of Wisconsin - Platteville and graduated with a Degree in Computer Science. After graduating, she began working at Great Lakes as a software Developer.</p> -->

    <p>Tom and Amanda's stories are very similar--Tom grew up in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and Amanda grew up in the Green Bay area. They both attended college and graduated with degrees in Computer Science. Both were offered jobs at Great Lakes out of college. The only difference was Tom worked out of the Eau Claire office and Amanda worked from the Madison office.</p>

    <p>The two were destined to meet, not long into their careers Tom and Amanda were put on the same team. Unfortunately, since they were remote they only saw eachother via a grainy video. Based on this poor quality video, Amanda may have thought that Tom was a middle aged man and was not attracted to him.</p>
    
    <p>Tom, however, noticed Amanda's work picture that was displayed in the company emails. I am not going to claim that this pictured played a part in his move to Madison, but it certainly didn't hurt. He moved to Madison in August of 2018 and then, Amanda <strong>did</strong> notice him.</p>

    <!--<p>Amanda enjoys cooking, singing, playing video games, reading, and nature. </p>-->
